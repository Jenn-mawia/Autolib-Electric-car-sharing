# Description
This is a brief analysis which I did on the Autolib' Electric car-sharing company. The company offers car-sharing(renting) services to its customers in various cities. The main aim of this project was to perform data mining and come up with answers to the questions as to how Autolib' can improve their services to ensure they realize more profits and retain existing customers.

# Analysis
Analysis was done on car usage logs for over a period of 9 days from 01-04-2018 to 09-04-2018. This was done using Python 3 using the pandas and numpy libraries. 
More focus was done on the city Paris and on the Blue Cars. This is because Paris is the most popular city out of the total 88 cities and Blue Cars are the most rented out cars. 

Since the most popular city is Paris with a total of 2816 stations, as this was the first city where the company began its operation, it can be assumed that a lot of focus has since thereof been put on Paris. It is much easier to retain already existing customers than it is to convince new customers. Therefore, the best recommendation here  is to increase the number of Blue cars stations to accommodate the high number of customers in the city. 
The least popular cities were: Le PrÃƒÂ©-Saint-Gervais, Saclay, Clichy la garenne, Saint-Maur, Epinay-sur-Seine with a count of 4,4,3,2,1 stations respectively. It can therefore be assumed that these are new cities which are still under ongoing phases of putting up Autolibâ€™s services and has fewer customers in these cities. It is therefore crucial that Autolib makes more expansions in these cities in order to grow their customer percentage.
